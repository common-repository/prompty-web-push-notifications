Easily integrate the Prompty web push notification service with your WordPress site.

== Description ==

This is Prompty's official plugin for WordPress web push notifications. Prompty is the easiest way to allow your users to subscribe and receive [web push notifications](https://www.prompty.io/) from your WordPress-powered website. This plugin makes integration effortless and allows you to control which pages you do (and do not) want your web push notification permission prompts to be displayed on.

To start using this plugin, you'll need to [signup for an account](https://app.prompty.io/register) - which is free, does not expire and does not limit the amount of notifications you can send. (When you grow, we make it easy to switch to a paid account that supports a greater number of subscribers.) Then simply follow the brief instructions on the plugin's settings page to get started.

For more information on how to use Prompty to send web push notifications with WordPress, see our [How it Works](https://www.prompty.io/how-it-works/) page.

Prompty is a third-party web push notification service for WordPress. Use of Prompty is subject to our [terms of service](https://app.prompty.io/terms).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to signup for Prompty to use this plugin? =
Yes, but it's [free to register](https://app.prompty.io/register).

= How do I configure this plugin? =
Please see this [step-by-step guide for WordPress](https://www.prompty.io/push-notification-plugin-for-wordpress/).

= It doesn't seem to work. What's wrong? =
Please see this [troubleshooting page](https://www.prompty.io/docs/general-help/why-isnt-my-prompt-displaying/).

= Does my site have to use HTTPS? =
Yes, HTTPS is required by the web push notification standard and we do not currently offer a workaround for plain HTTP sites. Though converting your site to HTTPS is a decision you should consider carefully, it is also beneficial to your site's security and search engine optimization. Because it's now common to be able to obtain certificates for free, it's easier than ever to secure your website. Your web host should be able to provide more information or guide you through this process.

= Which browsers do you support? =
Currently, we support Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera. Users can subscribe via any device (desktop or mobile) that supports at least one of these browsers, including Windows, Mac, or Linux systems.

= How do I send notifications, customize my opt-in or view reports? =
These actions are performed via [our web app](https://app.prompty.io/). Our API can also be used for most functions.

= Where can I find your API documentation? =
